    <h1>Best bikes in town</h1>
    <div>
        <p>HYBRID AND FITNESS BIKES. Good for: Urban riding, gentle off-road if you choose one with wider tyres

            The best hybrid bikes(opens in new tab) and best women's hybrids(opens in new tab) are the most popular
            choice when it comes to commuting. They're a mixture between road and mountain bikes - often combining a
            lightweight aluminium frame with slick yet wide tyres and disc brakes.

            There are many different styles of hybrid bike - some are closer to mountain bikes and come with suspension
            and wide tyres (35mm or more), whilst others are effectively road bikes with flat handlebars (with tyres
            around 25mm-28mm). We are also seeing a select few hybrid and fitness bikes adopting smaller 650b wheels
            which allow for super plump rubber that eats up rough roads and paths.

            If you are looking for an option that has speed as a priority, then head over to our page dedicated to
            finding you one of the best fitness bikes.

            However, we have included one or two below for commuters wanting to get some speed and distance, and to help
            with comparing your options.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>MOMENTUM TRANSEND E+ HYBRID E-BIKE. The Momentum Transend E+ adds a motor to make your commute that much
            easier, especially if it includes hills or lots of stop-start riding. There's a Yamaha motor with 250W/60Nm
            power output and five different modes that augment your pedal power and drive the bike through a Shimano
            Nexus 7-speed hub gear that cuts down on lubrication and maintenance.

            The 500Wh battery provides plenty of capacity and a range of up to 105 miles. It can be recharged by 80 per
            cent in under two hours. Stopping power comes from Tektro hydraulic disc brakes, while chunky 2.35" tyres
            and a quality Selle Royal saddle help make riding more comfortable.

            The Transend E+ is available either with a crossbar or step through frame and comes in a range of four
            cheerful colours.</p>

    <div>
        <p>MARIN PRESIDIO 2 HYBRID BIKE. Scoring nearly full marks on review, we concluded that the Marin's Presidio
            2(opens in new tab) was the ideal option for anyone who just wants a bike to get about on, without needing
            to fuss about or even bother cleaning it on a regular basis!

            It offers a double butted aluminium frame and fork, which is a higher spec than many bikes at this price
            point, and is a great foundation for providing a really comfortable ride.

            We adored the Shimano Nexus hub gear system. It effectively does away with an external cassette, so is super
            low maintenance in terms of wear and tear, and won't require the regular 'de-crudding' that a standard gear
            set up needs if a bike gets ridden in all weather. It also offers enough options for all but the hilliest of
            commutes with seven 'gears' to choose from thanks to the huge range they have. More experienced riders might
            find there are some large 'gaps' in this set up, but if you just want to know if you can ride it on the flat
            and uphill, the answer is most definitely yes.

            A set of powerful Shimano hydraulic disc brakes provide ample stopping ability, while the backswept
            handlebars make for a great relaxed and comfortable cockpit.

            If you're after one of the best commuter bikes for jobbing about town, and not much interested in the shiny
            pro look, then this is the one. </p>
